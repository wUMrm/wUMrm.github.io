We are wUMrm, a Capture The Flag (CTF) team, from [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt). ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹   
Our team was created in 2018, but only in 2019 it really started participating in CTFs.

You can find us here too: [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/83433).

If you are interested, you can [Join us](/joinus).

<br />

#### "Last but not least", we'd like to thank to everyone who has helped us along the way - and still does:
- University of Minho (especially the (staff from the) Information Systems Department and the (staff from the) Informatics Department);
- Professor David Brumley;
- STT (CTF team);
- xSTF (CTF team);
- And those we inadvertently may be forgetting to mention.

Thank you all!
 
<br />
